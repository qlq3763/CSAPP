The code that follows shows an example of branching on an enumerated type
value in a switch statement. Recall that enumerated types in C are simply a way
to introduce a set of names having associated integer values. By default, the values
assigned to the names go from zero upward. In our code, the actions associated
with the different case labels have been omitted.
