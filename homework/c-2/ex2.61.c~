/* Write C expressions that evaluate to 1 when the following conditions are true, and */

/* A. Any bit of x equals 1. */
/* B. Any bit of x equals 0. */
/* C. Any bit in the least significant byte of x equals 1. */
/* D. Any bit in the most significant byte of x equals 0. */
/* Your code should follow the bit-level integer coding rules (page 120), with the */
/* additional restriction that you may not use equality (==) or inequality (!=) tests. */
