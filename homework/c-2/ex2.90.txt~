Around 250 B.C., the Greek mathematician Archimedes proved that 223/71 < π < 22/7 .
Had he had access to a computer and the standard library <math.h>, he would have
been able to determine that the single-precision floating-point approximation of
π has the hexadecimal representation 0x40490FDB. Of course, all of these are just
approximations, since π is not rational.
A. What is the fractional binary number denoted by this floating-point value?
B. What is the fractional binary representation of
22
7 ?
Hint: See Problem 2.82.
C. At what bit position (relative to the binary point) do these two approxima-
tions to π diverge?
