/* Following the bit-level floating-point coding rules, implement the function with */
/* the following prototype: */
/* /\* Compute 2*f. If f is NaN, then return f. *\/ */
/* float_bits float_twice(float_bits f); */
/* For floating-point number f , this function computes 2.0 . f . If f is NaN, your */
/* function should simply return f . */
/* Test your function by evaluating it for all 232 values of argument f and com- */
/* paring the result to what would be obtained using your machine’s floating-point */
/* operations. */
