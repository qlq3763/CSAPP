/* Consider numbers having a binary representation consisting of an infinite string */

/* 1 */

/* representation of 3 is 0.01010101 . . . (y = 01), while the representation of 5 is */
/* . . . (y = 0011). */

/* A. Let Y = B2U k (y), that is, the number having binary representation y. Give */

/* Hint: Consider the effect of shifting the binary point k positions to the right. */
