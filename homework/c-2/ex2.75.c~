Suppose we want to compute the complete 2w-bit representation of x . y, where
both x and y are unsigned, on a machine for which data type unsigned is w bits.
The low-order w bits of the product can be computed with the expression x*y, so
we only require a procedure with prototype
unsigned int unsigned_high_prod(unsigned x, unsigned y);
that computes the high-order w bits of x . y for unsigned variables.
We have access to a library function with prototype
int signed_high_prod(int x, int y);
that computes the high-order w bits of x . y for the case where x and y are in twoâ€™s-
complement form. Write code calling this procedure to implement the function
for unsigned arguments. Justify the correctness of your solution.
