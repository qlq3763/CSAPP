Intel-compatible processors also support an “extended precision” floating-point
format with an 80-bit word divided into a sign bit, k = 15 exponent bits, a single
integer bit, and n = 63 fraction bits. The integer bit is an explicit copy of the
implied bit in the IEEE floating-point representation. That is, it equals 1 for
normalized values and 0 for denormalized values. Fill in the following table giving
the approximate values of some “interesting” numbers in this format:


                                        Extended precision
Description                          Value                      Decimal
Smallest positive denormalized      
Smallest positive normalized
Largest normalized
