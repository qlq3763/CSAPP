Consider a 16-bit floating-point representation based on the IEEE floating-point
format, with one sign bit, seven exponent bits (k = 7), and eight fraction bits
(n = 8). The exponent bias is 27−1 − 1 = 63.
Fill in the table that follows for each of the numbers given, with the following
instructions for each column:
Hex:
M:
E:
V:
The four hexadecimal digits describing the encoded form.
The value of the significand. This should be a number of the
form x or x , where x is an integer, and y is an integral
y
67
1
power of 2. Examples include: 0, 64 , and 256 .
The integer value of the exponent.
The numeric value represented. Use the notation x or
x × 2z , where x and z are integers.

As an example, to represent the number 8 , we would have s = 0, M = 4 , and
E = −1. Our number would therefore have an exponent field of 0x3E (decimal
value 63 − 1 = 62) and a significand field 0xC0 (binary 110000002 ), giving a hex
representation 3EC0.
You need not fill in entries marked “—”.
